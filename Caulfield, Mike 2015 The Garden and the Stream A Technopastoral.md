In this reading, we read of many things such as the link between  the Internet, mental health, and shootings. We then read of how the Internet is like a garden in a sense. Points about social media apps/websites are streams are linked. Caulfield then mentions the implications of all of these things. 

> liberal

- The author right away states his political views which allows the reader to make a decision based off this fact about whether they want to read the piece as well as form a bias about the author depending on their views.

> liberal

- The author again states his political view in the same sentence and gives an explanation as to why he notices the things that fit his political view. There is a repetition to his writing. This is not unlike the act of making punch cards or silk weaving. 

> collaboration.

- Internet = colloboration which can be linked to the idea of community in a work place ergo a factory such as the silk weaving factories where they would work in close quartrs and occasionally do part of their work at home as well with sometimes help from their family bringing in an element of family colloboration as well.

- Caufield mentions how there is no association between shootings and mental illness, and yet so many guns are used in the ending of one's life. 

We can link this to people having a warped sense of self through images of what they view as "perfect lives in photos", though sometimes what is in a photo is not real, therefore linking guns and one's mental state to the Internet and other types of media such as violent videogames played online as well as graphic movies and tv shows for which people often glorify on sites like reddit and twitter through reviews, painting these depictions as cool in a sense. Or videos on social media sites like Tiktok where you can see people shooting guns at targets for fun.

> a defined thing with given boundaries and a stated purpose.

The Internet started as this.  Which led to this :

> supports many approaches, many views, many seasons, maybe many uses, and the meaning of that bridge will even evolve for the architect over time.

- Most social media sites allow for the sharing of ideas and yet every now and then, there are debates of the ideas shared on it. Twitter is a prime example of a garden with various streams as one post can end up having multiple threads on it or multiple rivers of thought as one could say. - Internet is ever evolving.

> unique yet coherent experiences as they find their own paths through the garden.

- This is not unlike the internet or a library in which people come to those places to find one thing and leave more educated or not educated depending on what it is they are searching for, and it's availability and yet leave with an experience that is unique to them all the same.

> You can be active.

Not unlike how sites like Discord, Facebook, and Instagram allow their users to decide whether they want to be shown as active, do not disturb, or set custom statuses.
