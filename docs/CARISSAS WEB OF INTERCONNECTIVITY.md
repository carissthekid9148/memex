 [[Collaboration Caulfield, Mike 2015 The Garden and the Stream A Technopastoral]]

[[Internet is a colloborative place]]

[[We can link colloboration on the Internet can be linked to the idea of community in a work place ergo a factory such as the silk weaving factories where they would work in close quarters and occasionally do part of their work at home as well with sometimes help from their family bringing in an element of family colloboration as well]]

[[Caufield mentions how there is no association between shootings and mental illness, and yet so many guns are used in the ending of one's life Caulfield, Mike 2015 The Garden and the Stream A Technopastoral]]

[[We can link this to people having a warped sense of self through images of what they view as perfect lives in photos, though sometimes what is in a photo is not real]]

[[therefore linking guns and one's mental state to the Internet and other types of media such as violent videogames played online as well as graphic movies and tv shows for which people often glorify on sites like reddit and twitter through reviews, painting these depictions as cool in a sense ]] 

[[Or videos on social media sites like Tiktok where you can see people shooting guns at targets for fun]]

[[books,periodicals, newspapers, government documents,pictorial reproductions, motion pictures, phonographicrecords, manuscripts, maps, and microforms Kumar Shiv 2013 From Clay Tablets to Web ]] [[Examples of what libraries can house]]

[[Libraries]]

[[is a list]]

[[one example of the way a library's catalogue can take form]]

[[can seek and locate documents by author name,titles, subjects, series, and editors which, throuhout the ages, were considered efficient tools for navigating the vast library resources of the library]]

[[many ways of searching for an item… something that would not have been available in the early stages of technology]]

[[examples of the ways you can search]]

[[public and private libraries were common]]

[[Possible sense of secrecy as to how information was ordered…perhaps only known to those who worked there]] [[This is still a common idea in certain types of government libraries though in the public sector, books and documents usually fall into certain categories]]

[[The fall of Rome in the sixth century brought about the deliberate destruction and dispersion of the private,public and temple libraries ]]

[[One such group involved in the destructions were the pagans]]

[[only the main entry contained fairly bibliographical details with shorter ‘added entries’ after beingprepared in the form of simple cross references]]

[[Not unlike those of punch cards which allowed people to profile workers based on details given as a sort of early internet history census in a way]]

 [[There was however, an Internet Standage Tom The Victorian Internet the remarkable story of the telegraph and the nineteenth centurys on-line pioneers ]]
 
[[To develop machines, we first needed a database to which information about these machines would be uploaded. This is not unlike people coming to sites like Youtube to learn how to develop new skills such as that of learning an instrument Standage Tom The Victorian Internet the remarkable story of the telegraph and the nineteenth centurys on-line pioneers ]]

[[Another machine that was revolutionary was the silk printing presses which was essential in creating data during the Industrial Revolution Standage Tom The Victorian Internet the remarkable story of the telegraph and the nineteenth centurys on-line pioneers ]]

[[We can link telegraphs to code because spies would secret code messages and send them to their leaders during wars such as the First and Second World Wars. - Allied Forces was one such group nationalww2museum.org]]

[[Secret codes - a sort of personal made up language]]

[[the intenet nowadays has people coming up with slang terms of the daily - Greeks And Spartans also wrote secret messages]]

[[Technological subcultures are similar to that of highschool in that they have their own categories much like how in movies about highschool such as Mean Girls for example, categorizes people into group based on their interest]]

[[This is not unlike how apps and websites such as Youtube, Pinterest, Instagram, Snapchat, Twitter, Facebook, etc. as well as a great many others can be curated by their users to have feeds that are completely personalized to them Standage Tom The Victorian Internet the remarkable story of the telegraph and the nineteenth centurys on-line pioneers]]

[[Students reported that email was used in a near-synchronous manner at certain times of the week to chat with friends Caroline Haythornthwaite SOCIAL NETWORKS AND INTERNETCONNECTIVITY EFFECTS pg 10 ]] 

[[This kind of interaction was possible because the submission of assignments led them to be online at the same time Caroline Haythornthwaite SOCIAL NETWORKS AND INTERNETCONNECTIVITY EFFECTS pg 10]]

[[While there, they took advantage of the opportunity to check for friends online Caroline Haythornthwaite SOCIAL NETWORKS AND INTERNETCONNECTIVITY EFFECTS pg 10]]

[[In the era of the digital, we have websites and applications such as Discord, Zoom, Skype, and a great many others that allow users to collaborate virtually to do assignments]]

[[This kind of interaction was possible because the submission of assignments led them to be online at the same time Caroline Haythornthwaite SOCIAL NETWORKS AND INTERNETCONNECTIVITY EFFECTS pg 10]]

[[Silk weaving sometimes required two people working on a piece at the same time. In that age, because online did not exist, there is still however the idea of shared space though not digital as both people needed to be in the room at the same time]]

[[Google Docs allows for users to edit a singular document at the same time as another user ]]

[[Online friends also include more socializing and emotional support in their communications than Non-Friends  Caroline Haythornthwaite SOCIAL NETWORKS AND INTERNETCONNECTIVITY EFFECTS pg 11]]

[[Discord is a great example of this as is Twitter and Reddit]]

[[On social media apps/websites like Tiktok, Discord, Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, and Reddit, you can choose who you are friends with]] 

[[the more ‘traffic’ flows on the Internet, the more those without the means to access it are excluded from its information Caroline Haythornthwaite SOCIAL NETWORKS AND INTERNETCONNECTIVITY EFFECTS pg 16]]

[[In this, we see that this author also sees the Internet as a kind of superhighway]]

[[one hub to another, one person to another, one city to another, and their use has changed Caroline Haythornthwaite SOCIAL NETWORKS AND INTERNETCONNECTIVITY EFFECTS pg 16]]

[[We can relate this to the idea of collaboration as well as evolution as websites and apps have developed over time and been updated so that the functionality of them increases over time]]

[[Through the use of these Internet superhighway sites, people can share new ideas and debate]]

[[Through the Internet, we learn how to collaborate as well as other important values such as how to communicate]]

[[Gang members carry guns and twitter accounts]] 

[[Media outlets nationally have reported on a new phenomenon of gang affiliates using social media sites such as Twitter and Facebook and YouTube ]]

[[Guns]]

[[We can see that there is a link through this fact that social media can be linked to shootings so we can link this to the opposing argument by Caulfield as a counter argument]]

[[Google Hangouts and Google Docs also allow the sharing of information in terms of communication and working on assignments together]]

[[Youth have always founds public spaces to gather and gossip, provide support, compete for social status, collaborate and share information Wolff McDevitt Stark]] 

[[Websites like Facebook, YouTube and Twitter have sparked new communication modes for young people that are instant, intersect public and private domains and are readily available Wolff McDevitt Stark]]

[[Discord, Reddit, Skype, Zoom, are a few other examples of this]]

[[Communication]]

 [[Computer mediated communication (CMC) is defined as “communication that occurs within the context of the Internet or internetworks]]
 

[[As individuals feel free to express themselves without social repercussion, they take on alternative social roles and marginalized groups]]

[[The idea of common stereotypes is prevalent here. This can be linked to movies such as Mean Girls which shows examples of these social roles]]

[[Social]]

[[Users can hide behind profiles to comment on photos allowing for people's perceptions of how they look to be warped]]

[[changes in online behavior and usage created new and expedient ways of developing social networks, have allowed individuals to craft alter-egos]]

[[We can link this back to the idea of social stereotypes and roles mentioned earlier. And also our Mean Girls example]]
