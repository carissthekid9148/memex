This source focuses largely in part on the technological advancements of the 19th century such as machines like the telegraph. It talks about innovation in terms of the topic of electricity. The topic of early phone lines is another subject that come sup. 

Preface
 
 - "There was however, an Internet"

To develop machines, we first needed a database to which information about these machines would be uploaded. This is not unlike people coming to sites like Youtube to learn how to develop new skills such as that of learning an instrument.

Another machine that was revolutionary was the silk printing presses which was essential in creating data during the Industrial Revolution.

We can link telegraphs to code because spies would secret code messages and send them to their leaders during wars such as the First and Second World Wars. - Allied Forces was one such group

Secret codes - a sort of personal made up language - the intenet nowadays has people coming up with slang terms of the daily - Greeks And Spartans also wrote secret messages - Greeks had Caesar Cipher while Spartans used a scytale - where a message was written on a piece of paper and would be read using a special rod)

Technological subcultures are similar to that of highschool in that they have their own categories much like how in movies about highschool such as Mean Girls for example, categorizes people into group based on their interest. This is not unlike how apps and websites such as Youtube, Pinterest, Instagram, Snapchat, Twitter, Facebook, etc. as well as a great many others can be curated by their users to have feeds that are completely personalized to them.
 
"Internet is a superhighway" - we can relate this to Caulfield's idea of garden with streams

Chapter 1

Electricity uses wires to work- printing machines uses silk thread which a sort of fabric wire to work

Chappe brothers used a numbered dictionary to send coded messages - not unlike binary code for comupters that also uses numbers to output information  - libraries can take form this way
