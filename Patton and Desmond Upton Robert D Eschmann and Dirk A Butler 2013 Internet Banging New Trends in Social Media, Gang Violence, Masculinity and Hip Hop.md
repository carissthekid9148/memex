In this reading, the authors explore links between social media and gangs, the connectivity between the topic of guns/gun violence and certain genres of music that mention these topics as well as other related topics, and the topic of youth and social media and how it plays a role on the mental health of these youth. We get a sub genre about bullying which can be linked to the former topic just mentioned. The article also brings in how the Internet can be an educational tool through which young people colloborate on homework.



> Gang members carry guns and twitter accounts. Media outlets nationally have reported on a new phenomenon of gang affiliates using social media sites such as Twitter, Facebook and YouTube to trade insults or make violence threats that lead homicide or victimization.

We can see that there is a link through this fact that social media can be linked to shootings. We can link this to the opposing argument by Caulfield as a counter argument.

> Youth have always founds public spaces to gather and gossip, provide support, compete for social status, collaborate and share information.

Google Hangouts and Google Docs also allow the sharing of information in terms of communication and working on assignments together.

> Youth have always founds public spaces to gather and gossip, provide support, compete for social status, collaborate and share information. Websites like Facebook, YouTube and Twitter have sparked new communication modes for young people that are instant, intersect public and private domains and are readily available (Wolff, McDevitt, Stark, 2011)

Discord, Reddit, Skype, Zoom, are a few other examples of this.

> collaborate

Caulfield also mentions collaboration.

> collaborate

We can link this to the idea of assemblage from one of our class lectures.

> Computer mediated communication (CMC) is defined as “communication that occurs within the context of the Internet or internetworks”

Once again, we can see the idea of social media sites previously mentioned as examples of this.
