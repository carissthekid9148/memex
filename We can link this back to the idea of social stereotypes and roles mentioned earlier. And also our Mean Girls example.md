[[Social]]

[[As individuals feel free to express themselves without social repercussion, they take on alternative social roles and marginalized groups]]

[[The idea of common stereotypes is prevalent here. This can be linked to movies such as Mean Girls which shows examples of these social roles]]

[[Not unlike those of punch cards which allowed people to profile workers based on details given as a sort of early internet history census in a way]]

[[Technological subcultures are similar to that of highschool in that they have their own categories much like how in movies about highschool such as Mean Girls for example, categorizes people into group based on their interest]]
