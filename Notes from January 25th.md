**Notes from reading**

»         I assess a document as both a source of historical information—evidence about what “happened” in the past—and also as a rhetorically constructed text and cultural representation.

»        I try to read in advance the secondary literature on my research topics, 

»        mine these texts for their archival citations

»        I write ahead to archivists, make an appointment to visit the archives, and request documents in advance. I note the names of the archivists with whom I have corresponded and spoken. When I arrive, I attempt to establish cordial relations with them

»        I open up a Word document file for each source

»        keep a running bibliography

»        try to determine the conditions that generated this file

»        try to describe the materiality of the file, its size, variety of paper, layers of communication, and chronological ordering

»        take careful summary notes of what seem to be the most significant documents

»         back up my files 

»        write memos to myself about secondary or theoretical texts I need to consult in relation to this material

»        record the details or features that strike me as surprising or telling

»         photocopying and digital photography

»        Before I photograph, I place a rectangular piece of paper on the document that records its archival citation and maybe a keyword or two relating to its contents

»        To keep my notes in order when I am in “writing mode,” I print out notes from the computer and file them in file cabinets, arranging them alphabetically according to chapters. I keep a running index of this file system on my computer. I read over my hard-copy notes, annotating them and adding comments to idea files

»         index these notes in multiple formats

»        organize my notes into topics or themes by cutting and pasting text fragments and quotations, using a keyword search on my computer
